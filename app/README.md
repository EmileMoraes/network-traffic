# Network Traffic Monitoring System

*Objective:*  Create a simple system that monitors network traffic over a given period, using prefix sum to calculate the amount of data transmitted at specific intervals.

#### Functionalities:

Data Reading: The system reads a .txt file containing a sequence of integers, representing the amount of data transferred every second.

Prefix Sum Calculation: Calculates the prefix sum of the data sequence, storing the total amount of data transferred up to each second.

Interval Query: The user can query the amount of data transferred in a specific time interval, providing the start and end time of the query.
